# 📦 COVID-19 Parcel Delivery Impact Analysis

This data science project explores how COVID-19 impacted parcel volumes, customer behavior, and delivery business trends. It includes in-depth analysis through Python notebooks, Power BI dashboards, and presentation materials based on real-world parcel and customer datasets.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Project Title**: COVID-19 Parcel Volume and Business Impact
- **Author**: Ashish Pandya
- **Tools Used**: Python, Power BI, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, PowerPoint
- **Dataset Size**: 4 CSV files (~10K+ records total)
- **Goal**: Evaluate customer trends, parcel volume tiers, size-based preferences, and COVID disruptions in logistics.

---

## ❓ Business Questions Solved

- 📦 How did parcel delivery volumes change **before, during, and after COVID-19**?
- 🧍 Which **customer categories** contributed the most to volume trends?
- 📆 What were the **peak delivery weeks** during the pandemic?
- 🧮 Which **volume tiers** (small, medium, large) were most affected by delays or surges?
- 🔁 How did **customer growth rate** shift across regions and sizes?
- 📊 Which parcel sizes (M, L, XL) performed best during lockdown vs recovery periods?
- 📍 Were there any visible changes in **customer segment behavior** over time?
- 💼 How can the company **optimize delivery and inventory planning** based on trends?
